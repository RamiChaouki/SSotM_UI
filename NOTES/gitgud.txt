REMOTE FUNCTIONS
git remote add origin https://github.com/SpicyRiceTea/SSotM_UI.git
^connects your local repository to the remote url https://github.com/SpicyRiceTea/SSotM_UI.git AND gives it the nickname 'origin'. You could have written anything other than origin and it would still work. (e.g. git remote add project https://github.com/SpicyRiceTea/SSotM_UI.git).

git push --set-upstream origin main
SAME AS
git push -u origin main
^ when you 'set-upstream' (can be shortened to -u), you are linking your current local branch to the remote branch 'main' in the 'origin' repo. Any subsequent push does not need to mention 'origin' or 'main' since they have already been set as the default push location.

git remote show origin
^shows where each of the local branches push to in origin. origin can be replaced by the repository's https (e.g. git remote show https://github.com/SpicyRiceTea/SSotM_UI.git)

git branch -vv
^ does the same thing as 'git remote show origin' but does not include the Fetch and Push URL or which branch is the head
